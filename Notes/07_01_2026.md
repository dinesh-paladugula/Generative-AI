## Intelligence

**Intelligence** is about how well someone or something can learn from what happens, deal with new situations, understand tricky ideas, and use what they know to get things done. When we talk about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, we mean computers and machines that can do things that usually need human brains. This includes learning, understanding, solving problems, making choices, being creative, and even acting on their own. AI programs can see and recognize objects, understand and talk back in human languages, learn from new information, and give helpful advice. Sometimes, they can even do tasks without any human help, like a self-driving car.

## Human Intelligence

**Human intelligence** is the special way people think. It involves being able to do complex mental tasks, having strong reasons to do things, and knowing who you are. It's a mix of different mental skills like seeing, learning, remembering, thinking things through, and solving problems. All these skills work together to help us deal with the world around us. What makes human intelligence different from AI is that we also have creativity, gut feelings, and a sense of right and wrong. Scientists have many ideas about how human intelligence works, some think there's one main type of intelligence, while others believe there are many different kinds.

## Structured & Unstructured Data

Data is the basic stuff that AI and machine learning use. We can put data into two main groups: **structured** and **unstructured**.

**Structured data** is very neat and organized. It follows a clear plan, like information in a table with rows and columns. This makes it easy for people and computers to find, sort, and understand. Think of names, addresses, or sales records – they fit perfectly into categories.

**Unstructured data**, on the other hand, doesn't have a clear plan or organization. This makes it harder for computers to understand right away. This type of data includes many things like written documents, emails, social media posts, pictures, sounds, and videos. Even though it's harder to work with, unstructured data often holds very valuable information that can be used for advanced AI.

## Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a part of AI where computers learn from data without being told exactly what to do. The main idea is to show computers lots of examples so they can find patterns and then make their own guesses or decisions. There are a few ways ML works:

*   **Supervised Learning:** This is like learning with a teacher. The computer is given examples where it knows both the question and the right answer. It learns from these pairs to predict answers for new questions.
*   **Unsupervised Learning:** Here, the computer learns on its own without any right answers given. It looks for hidden patterns and groups in the data.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** This is like learning by trial and error. The computer tries different things and gets rewards for doing well and penalties for doing poorly. It learns the best way to reach a goal.

Machine learning is used in many everyday things, like recognizing faces, understanding what you say to your phone, finding fraud, and suggesting products you might like.
