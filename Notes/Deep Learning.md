Deep learning is a subset of machine learning driven by multilayered neural networks whose design is inspired by the structure of the human brain. Deep learning models power most state-of-the-art artificial intelligence(AI) today, from computer vision and generative AI(Gen AI) to self-driving cars and robotics.

## What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a machine learning model that stacks simple "neurons" in layers and learns pattern-recognizing weights and biases from data to map inputs to outputs.
